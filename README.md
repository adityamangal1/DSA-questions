# Coding interviews have never been more popular. With the boom of the internet, not only we got easier access to information, but also, the requirement for high - quality developers, reached an all time high. As the demand for high - quality developers increased, coding interviews became tougher and tougher. The questions around Data Structures and Algorithms have been a nemesis for developers all over.
